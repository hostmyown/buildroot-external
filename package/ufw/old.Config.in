          The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is
          particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a
          framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface
          for manipulating the firewall. ufw aims to provide an easy to use
          interface for people unfamiliar with firewall concepts, while at the
          same time simplifies complicated iptables commands to help an
          administrator who knows what he or she is doing. ufw is an upstream
          for other distributions and graphical frontends.
